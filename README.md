# 3D MAPs

3D MAPs performs morphometric and statistical analysis of cells and nuclei in a whole tissue in MATLAB. 

This code was written by Paul Villoutreix and Ankit Agrawal. To learn about 3D MAPs, read the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.225409v1/).

## System Requirements

Linux, Windows and Mac OS are supported for running the code. 3D MAPs scripts are written and compiled with MATLAB version R2016b and depend on MATLAB toolbox "Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox". It was tested primarily on a workstation with Windows 10 and 512 GB RAM. 

## Installation

This process should take less than 10 minutes.

1. Install MATLAB version 2016b or later.
2. Download the files from the 3D MAPS repository. You can do this by cloning the repository or by downloading it as a ZIP folder.
3. Unzip the folder and place your data inside of the folder titled "data" (See Running 3D MAPs).
