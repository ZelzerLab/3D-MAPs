# 3D MAPs

3D MAPs performs morphometric and statistical analysis of cells and nuclei in a whole tissue in MATLAB. 

This code was written by Paul Villoutreix and Ankit Agrawal. To learn about 3D MAPs, read the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.225409v1/).

## System Requirements

Linux, Windows and Mac OS are supported for running the code. 3D MAPs scripts are written and compiled with MATLAB version R2016b and depend on MATLAB toolbox "Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox". It was tested primarily on a workstation with Windows 10 and 512 GB RAM.
